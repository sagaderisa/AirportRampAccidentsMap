AirportRampAccidentsMap2
========================

Airport ramps are one of the most dangerous areas in the airport for workers, and yet no one has been systematically tracking these accidents. This map documents accidents that have occurred on the ramp. These accidents are difficult to track because OSHA, NTSB, and the FAA all oversee some but not all accidents. It is difficult to analyze data because while NTSB and FAA collect airport names but not addresses, OSHA only collects addresses. This code will add airport names and main addresses to OSHA data, and address information to NTSB and FAA data.
